# Terminal Resume

Interactive terminal-themed resume website to showcase my background. It simulates a real Unix command-line interface where you can navigate through my professional story using actual terminal commands.

## Usage 

Open `index.html` in your browser. Type `help` to see commands. 

## Features 

### Unix Terminal Feeling
- **Classic Look**: That nostalgic green-on-black terminal vibe with a blinking cursor
- **Authentic Behavior**: Proper spacing, monospace fonts, and realistic terminal window

### File System
- **Real Unix Commands**: Use `ls`, `cd`, `cat`, `pwd`, `tree`, `clear`, `history`, `help` like a pro
- **Smart Paths**: Works with both relative (`education/uc-berkeley.txt`) and absolute (`/education/uc-berkeley.txt`) paths
- **Tab Completion**: Because who wants to type everything out? Hit tab to auto-complete!
